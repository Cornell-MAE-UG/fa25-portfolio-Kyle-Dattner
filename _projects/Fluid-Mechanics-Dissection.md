As part of a class project, we were tasked with dissecting a machine and analyzing it through a fluid mechanics lense, then making an instructional video showing our findings and teaching others how the machine works. My group specifically was given a coffee machine to dissect, which we found has many fluid mechanics applications.

My role in particular was to apply the hydrostatic equation and Bernoulli's equation to the coffee machine. I analyzed the pressure differences created in the pipes, the theoretical pressure difference required from the heating element, and the theoretical exit speed of the fluid that you calculate from applying Bernoulli's.
